Interventions to increase physical activity.

## Notes
* [Interventions to Increase Physical Activity Among Healthy Adults: Meta-Analysis of Outcomes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3052337/)

* Meta-analysis - 99,011 total participants
* Behavioral > cognitive interventions
* Face-to-face delivery > mediated interventions
* Targeting individuals > communities

Many publications have investigated health outcomes, while few have investigated behavior outcomes.

* Unsupervised physical activity > supervised activity
* Measuring low-intensity activity is good
* Measuring active leisure > structured exercise
* Targeting participants of diverse ages is good
* Targeting groups > individuals

Behavioral interventions
* Goal-setting
* Self-monitoring
* Physical activity behavior feedback
* Consequences
* Exercise perscription
* Cues

Health education does not increase impact

* Future primary research could compare types of behavioral interventions
