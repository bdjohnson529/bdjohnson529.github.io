My name is Ben Johnson, and I am a software engineer and technical product manager at DNV GL. I studied physics at USC, and have built software for diverse industries including defense and agriculture. I am interested in product management and education.

Away from the keyboard you can find me on the basketball court or studying languages. I am fascinated by languages of any sort, be it programming languages, or natural languages.
