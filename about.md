My name is Ben Johnson, and I am currently working as a software engineer at DNV GL. I studied physics at USC, and have built software for diverse industries including defense and agriculture. I am interested in sustainability, health care and education.

Away from the keyboard you can probably find me cooking or eating. I am currently working on cataloging the many ways to cook yams.
